# On the Map (3/5)

This is the third part of a five part series of sample apps created for [Udacity's Nanodegree "Become an iOS Developer"](https://udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).

With On the Map you can pin a link on a _MapView_ at a location. All other Udacity students implement their own version 
of the app and can view the links of other students. To be able to access the app's functions you first have to 
log in using an Udacity account.

Learning goal of this app was to learn how to handle __(REST-)APIs__. This includes:

* Authentication (and authorisation) at APIs via SessionIDs and processes similar to OAuth.
* Interacting with an API via HTTP-Methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
